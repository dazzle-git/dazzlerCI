			<p>It’s all about maximizing flexibility for you and your fans. WAV, AIFF and FLAC are high-fidelity (lossless) formats. By starting with the highest possible quality
source, we’re able to convert your tracks into a bunch of different format and quality combinations, including MP3 (320, VBR V0), Ogg Vorbis, Apple Lossless,
FLAC and AAC (aka .m4a or iTunes store format). Sure, most fans will just want the MP3 and won’t know or care about anything else, but there’s a rabid
minority out there who will love that you’re giving them a choice. And if a new format/quality becomes à la mode (like when Amazon’s MP3 store made
iTunes’ 128k AACs seem antiquated), we’ll transcode to that too, without you having to do a thing.
